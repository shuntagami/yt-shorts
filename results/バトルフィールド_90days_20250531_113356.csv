Released in 2018, it is part of the long-running Battlefield series and is set during World War II. The game focuses on large-scale, team-based battles with an emphasis on realism and squad cooperation.  #gamingshorts   Key Features of Battlefield 1: World War II Setting – Unlike previous Battlefield games that focused on modern or futuristic warfare, BFV takes players back to WWI with historically inspired weapons, vehicles, and locations.  Grand Operations Mode – A large-scale multiplayer mode where battles span multiple in-game days, changing objectives and maps as the battle progresses.  Firestorm (Battle Royale Mode) – Introduced later, Firestorm was BFV’s attempt at a Battle Royale mode, featuring a shrinking battlefield and survival mechanics.  War Stories (Single-Player Mode) – Instead of a traditional campaign, BFV offers short, narrative-driven missions based on different perspectives of WWII.  Fortifications System – Players can build fortifications such as sandbags, barbed wire, and tank traps to defend positions.  Attrition System – Players have limited health and ammo, requiring more reliance on teammates and supply stations.
